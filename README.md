This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

-Link component enables **client-side navigation**, which uses Javscript. This is faster than default navigation by browser. In NextJS version, link does not load the full page.
-**Code splitting** load first page assets first, other pages loaded later.
-**Prefetching** loads Links to other pages in background, page transition near instant.

-Assets like images go in **public folder**, '/image.jpg' is sufficient to locate.
-**styled-jsx** write CSS in React Component and other components not affected
